## Mechanism design with cash-constrained agents

This paper studies ex post efficient partnership dissolution when partners are cash constrained. 

## Optimal allocation of penalties with judgment-proof injurers

I characterize the optimal regulation of a firm constituted by potential judgment-proof
agents. The firm can be either a principal and an agent or a two-agent
partnership. In both cases, agents are in charge of exerting an unobservable level
of safety care to reduce the probability of an accident that may occur due to the
firm risky activity. Agents are called judgment proof when their final wealth is not
enough to pay for the monetary penalties imposed by the regulator. In a principal agent
firm, the optimal regulation requires to fully target the principal who can
always pay for the penalty. In a two-agent firm, the optimal regulation consists in
an almost equal sharing of penalties among agents, the agent with a higher expected
final wealth always being more targeted.
