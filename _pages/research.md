## Partnership dissolution with cash-constrained agents

*Abstract:* When partnerships come to an end, their members must find a way to reallocate
the commonly owned assets among themselves. A dissolution is ex post efficient
if it allocates the assets to the members who value them the most. Although, this
requires that the aforementioned members possess enough financial resources to
buy out the othersâ€™ shares.

In this paper, I investigate ex post efficient partnership dissolution when agents
are ex post cash constrained. I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ex post
efficient partnership dissolution with Bayesian (resp. Dominant Strategy) incentive
compatible, interim individually rational, ex post (resp. ex ante) budget balanced
and ex post cash-constrained mechanisms.

I show that the optimal ownership structures for ex post efficient dissolution
allocate more initial property rights to partners with low cash resources. I also
show that the usual equivalence theorem between Bayesian and Dominant Strategy
implementation is robust to the addition of cash constraints. Furthermore, I propose
a bidding game that satisfies all the constraints and can be applied to actual
partnership dissolution problems due to its simplicity.

Finally, I investigate the second-best mechanisms when cash constraints are such
that ex post efficient dissolution is not attainable.

## Optimal allocation of penalties with judgment-proof injurers

*Abstract:* I characterize the optimal regulation of a firm constituted by potential judgmentproof
agents. The firm can be either a principal and an agent or a two-agent
partnership. 

In both cases, agents are in charge of exerting an unobservable level
of safety care to reduce the probability of an accident that may occur due to the
firm risky activity. Agents are called judgment proof when their final wealth is not
enough to pay for the monetary penalties imposed by the regulator. 

In a principal agent firm, the optimal regulation requires to fully target the principal who can
always pay for the penalty. In a two-agent firm, the optimal regulation consists in
an almost equal sharing of penalties among agents, the agent with a higher expected
final wealth always being more targeted.
