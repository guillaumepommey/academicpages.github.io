## Mechanism design with cash-constrained agents

When businesses come to an end, their members must find a way to reallocate the
business assets among themselves. A dissolution is ex post efficient if it allocates the
assets to the members who value them the most. Although, this requires that the
aforementioned members possess enough financial resources to buy out the others’
share.
In this paper, I investigate ex post efficient dissolution when agents are ex post
financially constrained. I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ex post efficient
partnership dissolution with Bayesian (resp. Dominant Strategy) incentive compatible,
interim individually rational, ex post (resp. ex ante) budget balanced and ex post cash
constrained mechanisms.
I show that the optimal ownership structures for ex post efficient dissolution allocate
more initial property rights to partners with low cash resources. I also show that the
usual equivalence theorem between Bayesian and Dominant Strategy implementation is
robust to the addition of cash constraints. Finally, I propose a bidding game that satisfies
all the constraints and can be applied to actual partnership dissolution problems due to
its simplicity.

## Optimal allocation of penalties with judgment-proof injurers

I characterize the optimal regulation of a firm constituted by potential judgment-proof
agents. The firm can be either a principal and an agent or a two-agent
partnership. In both cases, agents are in charge of exerting an unobservable level
of safety care to reduce the probability of an accident that may occur due to the
firm risky activity. Agents are called judgment proof when their final wealth is not
enough to pay for the monetary penalties imposed by the regulator. In a principal agent
firm, the optimal regulation requires to fully target the principal who can
always pay for the penalty. In a two-agent firm, the optimal regulation consists in
an almost equal sharing of penalties among agents, the agent with a higher expected
final wealth always being more targeted.
