## Partnership Dissolution with Cash-Constrained Agents (**Job Market Paper**)

*Abstract:* When partnerships come to an end, partners must find a way to efficiently reallocate the commonly owned assets to those who value them the most. This requires that the aforementioned members possess enough financial resources to buy out others' shares. I investigate ex post efficient partnership dissolution when agents are ex post cash constrained. I derive necessary and sufficient conditions for ex post efficient partnership dissolution with Bayesian (resp. dominant strategy) incentive compatible, interim individually rational, ex post (resp. ex ante) budget balanced and ex post cash-constrained mechanisms. Ex post efficient dissolution is more likely to be feasible when agents with low (resp. large) cash resources own more (resp. less) initial ownership rights. Furthermore, I propose a simple auction to implement the optimal mechanism. Finally, I investigate second-best mechanisms when cash constraints are such that ex post efficient dissolution is not attainable.

## Optimal Allocation of Penalties with Judgment-Proof Injurers

*Abstract:* I characterize the optimal regulation of a firm constituted by potential judgmentproof
agents. The firm can be either a principal and an agent or a two-agent
partnership. In both cases, agents are in charge of exerting an unobservable level
of safety care to reduce the probability of an accident that may occur due to the
firm risky activity. Agents are called judgment proof when their final wealth is not
enough to pay for the monetary penalties imposed by the regulator. In a principal agent firm, the optimal regulation requires to fully target the principal who can always pay for the penalty. In a two-agent firm, the optimal regulation consists in an almost equal sharing of penalties among agents, the agent with a higher expected final wealth always being more targeted.
